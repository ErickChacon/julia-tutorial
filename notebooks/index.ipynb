    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial covers the basic elements of the Julia programming language. Most of the\n",
    "topics are taken from the official [Julia documentation](https://docs.julialang.org),\n",
    "check it for more detailed information.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Get started\n",
    "\n",
    "The three main ways of using Julia are by writing commands directly in an *interactive\n",
    "session*, working with *scripts*, and working with *notebooks*. These are described\n",
    "below.\n",
    "\n",
    "### An interactive session\n",
    "\n",
    "You can start using Julia on an interactive session by running `julia` from the command\n",
    "line. Once it is opened, you can execute Julia commands:\n",
    "\n",
    "```julia\n",
    "10 ^ 2\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The session can be closed using `CTRL-D` or typing `exit()` inside Julia session.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Scripts\n",
    "\n",
    "Julia scripts have extension `*.jl`. An script is just a file containing Julia commands.\n",
    "The script `src/00-file.jl` has the following commands:\n",
    "\n",
    "```julia\n",
    "x = [1, 3]\n",
    "for i in x\n",
    "    println(i)\n",
    "end\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We can evaluate this script using the function `include`.\n",
    "\n",
    "```julia\n",
    "include(\"src/00-file.jl\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "A custom script with optional arguments can also be evaluated non-interactively (on a\n",
    "terminal) providing the script name as a first argument to the `julia` command.\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "julia script.jl arg1 arg2\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the script name is passed to the global variable `PROGRAM_FILE`. Similarly,\n",
    "the arguments are passed to `ARGS`.\n",
    "\n",
    "As an example the script `src/00-script.jl` prints the filename and the arguments\n",
    "provided.\n",
    "\n",
    "```julia\n",
    "println(PROGRAM_FILE)\n",
    "for x in ARGS\n",
    "    println(x)\n",
    "end\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We can execute it as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "julia src/00-script.jl 1 10 100\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Notebooks\n",
    "\n",
    "Notebooks are an interactive way to execute code, but also add formated markdown text.\n",
    "You are probably looking at this file as a notebook. In this course, we will mainly use\n",
    "notebooks given that it is easier for students to start up."
